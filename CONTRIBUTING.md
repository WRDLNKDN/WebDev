## 📝 Code Style & Quality

We enforce **Logic Purity** through automated tooling. Please ensure your code
passes our local "System Audits" before pushing:

- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to catch errors.
- **Formatting**: Run `npm run format` to align with Prettier rules.
- **Type Safety**: Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript logic.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive messages. We recommend **Signed
  Commits** (GPG/SSH) for verification.

_Note: This repo uses **Husky**. Pre-commit hooks will automatically block
commits that fail linting or formatting checks._

## 🏷️ Labels & Triage

- **Issues and PRs** are labeled for clarity (e.g., `bug`, `feature`,
  `help wanted`).
- **Milestones** track major releases and goals.
- **Code Review**: All contributions require at least one review before merging.

## 🤝 Onboarding & Agreements

Most casual contributions (typos, small bug fixes) do **not** require formal
onboarding.

However, if you plan to:

- Contribute on an ongoing basis
- Take ownership of a feature
- Incur reimbursable expenses

You must complete onboarding and accept the Contributor Agreement **before
proceeding**.

- **Step 2: Legal Source of Truth**
  [https://github.com/WRDLNKDN/Agreements/wiki/Contributor-Agreement](https://github.com/WRDLNKDN/Agreements/wiki/Contributor-Agreement)

_This repository does not duplicate agreement text; the wiki is the single
source of truth._
