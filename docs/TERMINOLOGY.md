# Terminology and Language Standards

[← Docs index](./README.md)

**Status:** In Review  
**Applies To:** All product surfaces, documentation, EPICs, UX copy, and
contributor submissions

## Purpose

Establish canonical vocabulary for WRDLNKDN to ensure consistency across UI,
documentation, governance, and development work.

**No terminology drift without approval.**

---

## 1. Core Identity Terms

**Member** : The canonical term for a person on the platform.

**Profile** : A Member's identity page.

**Directory** : The platform surface used to discover Members.

**Feed** : Primary post-sign-in content surface.

**Groups** : Organized sub-communities within WRDLNKDN.

**Community** : Refers to WRDLNKDN as a whole. **Not used as a feature label.**

**Avatar** : The visual image displayed for a Member in the UI. An Avatar may
be: a profile photo, a Weirdling, or another approved image type. **Avatar
refers only to the display layer.**

**Weirdling** : A WRDLNKDN-generated identity creature that represents a
Member's tone, role, and self-expression. A Weirdling is a type of Avatar, but
not all Avatars are Weirdlings. Weirdlings are identity artifacts, not just
profile pictures. They function as symbolic self-representations unique to
WRDLNKDN.

**Link** : A URL or external reference added to a Profile. Used only to describe
external resources. **Not interchangeable with Connection.**

---

## 2. Relationship Terms

**Connection** : The relationship between two Members.

**Connect** : Action to initiate a Connection.

**Pending** : Connection request sent but not yet accepted.

**Accept** : Approve a Connection request.

**Decline** : Reject a Connection request.

**Connected** : Active Connection state.

**Disconnect** : Remove an existing Connection.

---

## 3. Interaction Terms

**Post** : Create content in the Feed.

**Comment** : Respond to a Post.

**React** : Respond to content with a reaction.

**Message** : Send a direct message.

**Chat** : Real-time messaging surface.

---

## 4. Location Standard

Location format must be:

- **City, State** — Example: Seattle, WA
- For international Members: **City, Region** or **City, Country** where
  applicable
- **No zip codes**
- **No full street addresses**

---

## 5. Disallowed Terms

**Do not use** the following terms in product UI or documentation:

- User
- Contact
- Unfriend
- Guild

**Do not use "Link" to describe Member relationships.** Use **Connection**
instead.

---

## 6. Governance Rule

All new feature proposals, EPICs, and UX changes must use canonical terminology.

If a new term is proposed:

1. It must be reviewed.
2. It must be added here before use.
3. No parallel synonyms are allowed in the UI.

**Consistency is part of product integrity.**
