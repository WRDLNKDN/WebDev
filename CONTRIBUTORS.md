# 👥 Contributors

This page acknowledges the people who have contributed time, effort, and ideas
to the WRDLNKDN project.

It is **not** the system of record for contributor participation.

## Source of Truth (IMPORTANT)

The authoritative record of stakeholders and contributors is maintained in the
official WRDLNKDN Google Drive.

**Stakeholders and Contributors (Read-Only):**  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZCn5OZLiO7s1oRL5d9zkjlYf6bLdQs4WaudxdI78ZE/edit?usp=drive_link

This spreadsheet reflects:

- Contributor-submitted information
- Self-identified roles and interests
- Committee participation
- Ongoing and historical involvement

Updates, corrections, or additions should be made through the contributor intake
process, not by editing this repository file.

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized across technical, creative, security, operational,
and advisory roles.

Recognition here is **honorary**, editorial, and non-exhaustive.  
Inclusion or omission does not confer authority, ownership, or status.
