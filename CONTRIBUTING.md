## 🤝 Contributor Onboarding and Agreements

Most casual contributions do **not** require onboarding or agreement acceptance.

If you plan to:
- Contribute on an ongoing basis  
- Take ownership of work  
- Incur reimbursable expenses  

You must complete onboarding and accept the Contributor Agreement **before proceeding**.

Start here:
- **Contributor Onboarding**  
	https://github.com/WRDLNKDN/WebDev/wiki/Contributor-Onboarding

Authoritative agreement text lives here:
- **WRDLNKDN Agreements Wiki (Source of Truth)**  
	https://github.com/WRDLNKDN/Agreements/wiki/Contributor-Agreement

This repository does not duplicate agreement text.
