**Professional networking, but human.**

WRDLNKDN is a modern, accessibility-first professional directory and platform.  
It explores what professional presence and connection look like when we stop
pretending it has to be polished, performative, or predictable.

---

## 🌐 Platform Overview

WRDLNKDN consists of:

- **Frontend**

  - React 19 + Vite UI
  - Designed for GoDaddy website integration
  - WCAG 2.2 AA compliant dark theme

- **Backend**
  - API deployed on Vercel
  - Handles profiles, moderation, and directory access
  - Built to scale beyond initial launch without redesign
