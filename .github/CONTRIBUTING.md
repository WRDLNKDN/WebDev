# Contribution & Labeling Guidelines

Welcome to the WebDev project! To keep our workflow sharp, scalable, and easy for everyone, please follow these simple rules for labeling and milestones:

## Labeling Guidelines

- **Each issue must have exactly one `type:*` label.**
  - `type:Feature`
  - `type:Bug`
  - `type:Tech-debt`
  - `type:NFR`
  - `type:Spike`

- **Each issue may have at most one `Pri:*` label.**
  - `Pri:Must`
  - `Pri:Should`
  - `Pri:Could`
  - `Pri:Won’t`

- **Triage labels are temporary and should be removed once resolved.**
  - `duplicate`, `invalid`, `question`, `help wanted`

## Why this system?
- One clear axis per label family—no overlap, no confusion.
- Consistent naming (`type:`, `Pri:`) makes filtering, automation, and onboarding easy.
- No “status:in progress” or vibes-based priorities—just clear, actionable labels.

## Milestones
- Milestones should map to major deliverables, sprints, or roadmap goals.
- Pair `Pri:*` labels with milestones for clear prioritization.

**Current Milestone Conventions:**
- `Phase 1` (MVP): Minimum viable product, must-have features for launch.
- `Phase 2` (MVP +1): Next set of improvements and enhancements after MVP.
- `Phase Future` (Undefined timeline): Ideas and features for the long-term roadmap, not yet scheduled.

## House Rules
1. Each issue must have exactly one `type:*` label.
2. Each issue may have at most one `Pri:*` label.
3. Triage labels are for temporary use only.
4. Each issue should be assigned to a milestone (`Phase 1`, `Phase 2`, or `Phase Future`) to clarify its place in the roadmap.

Keep it boring, sharp, and effective. If you have questions, open an issue or ask in the project discussion!
