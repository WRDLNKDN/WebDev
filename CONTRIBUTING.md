## 🤝 Contributor Onboarding, Records, and Agreements

Most casual contributions do **not** require onboarding or agreement acceptance.

If you plan to:

- Contribute on an ongoing basis
- Take ownership of work
- Incur reimbursable expenses
- Join committees or planning activities
- Represent WRDLNKDN in an official or operational capacity

You must complete onboarding and accept the Contributor Agreement **before
proceeding**.

### Start Here

## 📄 Contributor Agreement (Source of Truth)

Authoritative agreement text lives here:

- **WRDLNKDN Agreements Wiki**  
  https://github.com/WRDLNKDN/Agreements/wiki/Contributor-Agreement

This repository does not duplicate agreement text.

## 📛 Naming and Trademark Reminder (IMPORTANT)

Contributors are expected to follow project naming and trademark guidance in all
code, documentation, metadata, and public references.

Before contributing, review:

- **Naming and Trademark Guidance**  
  https://github.com/WRDLNKDN/WebDev/wiki/Naming-and-Trademark-Guidance

This protects contributors and the project by avoiding implied affiliation or
confusing usage.
