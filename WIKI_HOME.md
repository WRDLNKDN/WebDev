# 👋 Welcome to the WeirdLinkedIn WebDev Wiki

This is the high-level context and orientation space for the **WeirdLinkedIn** project, living in the  
**WRDLNKDN/WebDev** GitHub repository.

This wiki exists to explain the _why_, the _shape_, and the _intent_ behind what we’re building.

---

## 📚 Start Here

- **[Project README](../blob/main/README.md)**  
  The source of truth for what this project is, how it works, and how to get rolling.

- **[Contribution & Labeling Rules](../blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)**  
  The rules of the road for issues, labels, milestones, and keeping our workflow sharp.

> **Note:**
>
> - `CONTRIBUTING.md` = How to contribute, code style, PR process, and workflow rules.
> - `CONTRIBUTORS.md` = Credits and thanks to project contributors.

## 🧭 What This Wiki Is (and Isn’t)

### This wiki **is**:

- The place for high-level project context, vision, and rationale
- Where architectural overviews, design intent, and long-form thinking live
- Where we document _why_ decisions were made, not just _what_ was done

### This wiki **isn’t**:

- A dumping ground for process rules or task-level instructions
- A duplicate of the README or CONTRIBUTING files
- A replacement for issues, pull requests, or code comments
