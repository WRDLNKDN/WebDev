# Terminology Standards

Use canonical vocabulary from `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md`. Key rules:

## Use These Terms

- **Member** — not "User" or "Contact"
- **Profile** — identity page
- **Connection** — relationship between Members (not "Link" for people)
- **Link** — external URL on a Profile only
- **Avatar** — display image (profile photo, Weirdling, etc.)
- **Weirdling** — identity creature; type of Avatar
- **Feed** — primary content surface
- **Directory** — discover Members
- **Post** — create content in Feed
- **Comment**, **React**, **Message**, **Chat** — interaction terms

## Disallowed

- User, Contact, Unfriend, Guild
- "Link" for Member relationships (use Connection)
- Zip codes or full street addresses (Location: City, State)

## Governance

No terminology drift. New terms require review and addition to `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md` before use.
